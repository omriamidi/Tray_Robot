# Tray Robot

Background -

As part of an academic research done in a technological laboratory at Reichman University, I am building and programming a tray-shaped robot designed to be an assistant to humans, to whom it serves objects of various shapes. The purpose of the research is to test the reaction of humans to the different serving styles that we create with the robot.

Design of the lower part (versoin 1):

A surface on which 3 motors are placed, where each motor is connected to an arm with the ability to move freely. The top of the tray is attached by magnets to the 3 arms.

Note -
Since I am still in the process of developing the software for version 4 of the robot, the new design of the robot (including rotary and linear motion) has not yet been implemented, so there are no pictures illustrating the motion.
